"""
Official TensorFlow implementation of the Hessian Penalty regularization term from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10599.pdf
Author: Bill Peebles
PyTorch Implementation (GPU + Multi-Layer): hessian_penalty_pytorch.py
Simple Pure NumPy Implementation: hessian_penalty_np.py

Simple use case where you want to apply the Hessian Penalty to the output of net w.r.t. net_input:
>>> from hessian_penalty_tf import hessian_penalty
>>> net = MyNeuralNet()
>>> net_input = sample_input()
>>> loss = hessian_penalty(net, z=net_input)  # Compute hessian penalty of net's output w.r.t. net_input

If your network takes multiple inputs, simply supply them to hessian_penalty as you do in the net's forward pass. In the
following example, we assume BigGAN takes a second input argument "y". Note that we always take the Hessian
Penalty w.r.t. the z argument supplied to hessian_penalty:
>>> from hessian_penalty_tf import hessian_penalty
>>> net = BigGAN()
>>> z_input = sample_z_vector()
>>> class_label = sample_class_label()
>>> loss = hessian_penalty(net, z=net_input, y=class_label)

    """
    Official TensorFlow Hessian Penalty implementation.

    Note: If you want to regularize multiple network activations simultaneously, you need to
    make sure the function G you pass to hessian_penalty returns a list of those activations when it's called with
    G(z, **G_kwargs). Otherwise, if G returns a tensor the Hessian Penalty will only be computed for the final
    output of G.

    :param G: Function that maps input z to either a tensor or a list of tensors (activations)
    :param z: Input to G that the Hessian Penalty will be computed with respect to
    :param k: Number of Hessian directions to sample (must be >= 2)
    :param epsilon: Amount to blur G before estimating Hessian (must be > 0)
    :param reduction: Many-to-one function to reduce each pixel/neuron's individual hessian penalty into a final loss
    :param return_separately: If False, hessian penalties for each activation output by G are automatically summed into
                              a final loss. If True, the hessian penalties for each layer will be returned in a list
                              instead. If G outputs a single tensor, setting this to True will produce a length-1
                              list.
    :param G_z: [Optional small speed-up] If you have already computed G(z, **G_kwargs) for the current training
                iteration, then you can provide it here to reduce the number of forward passes of this method by 1
    :param G_kwargs: Additional inputs to G besides the z vector. For example, in BigGAN you
                     would pass the class label into this function via y=<class_label_tensor>

    :return: A differentiable scalar (the hessian penalty), or a list of hessian penalties if return_separately is True
